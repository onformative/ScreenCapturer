We experienced, when working on projects where we had to include videos into processing, that it’s really time and nerve consuming to add video files to Processing. You need to take care of the resolution, the codec and the size of the video file in order to make it suit your specific requirements. Furthermore you might not even have access to the video file at all and just want to test some video in your sketch- that’s why we thought of a different approach to including any kind of video into Processing.


The ScreenCapturer library for Processing enables you to capture any part of your screen and include this capture into your Processing sketch. With this you can try out video or image input in your Processing sketch without having to change the video/image import lines in your source code and don’t have to worry about problems regarding resolution, codec etc. Sometimes you can’t even include them, simply because you want import video that you are watching on Vimeo/Youtube and don’t have access to the video file itself. With this tool you can simply play a video in your browser or from your hard drive and move the ScreenCapturer window on top of your video and access everything inside this window frame from your Processing sketch.
